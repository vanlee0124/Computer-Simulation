Ownership belongs to Fan Li,George Schimck,Pawel Perzan, Amit Deshpande.

Purpose:

To give you a deeper understanding of the design, structure and operations of a computer system, principally focusing on the ISA and how it is executed. In addition, we will also focus on memory structure and operations, and simple I/O capabilities.

Components:

The four components are:

I: Basic Machine	Design and implement the basic machine architecture.
Implement a simple memory
Execute Load and Store instructions
Build initial user interface to simulator

II: Memory and Cache Design	Design and implement the modules for enhanced memory and cache operations
Extend the user interface.
Demonstrate 1st program running on your simulator.

III: Execute All
Instructions	Make sure all instructions ( as specified below) execute on your simulator

IV: 
A. Floating Point and Vector Operations
B: Enhanced Scheduling	Design and implement the modules for floating point and vector operations and simple pipelining; extend the user interface
Design and implement simple branch prediction and speculative execution, trap if an error occurs to an error handling routine.
